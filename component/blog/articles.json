As a full-stack developer, I often develop the front- and back-end simultaneously while requiring to serve resources \n\n- dynamic\n- selective (don't want a particular view\/endpoint to load unused components)\n- fast\n- without additional development servers, build processes etc.\n\n## Manipulating the way neoan3 serves files\n\nWhether it be the serve.file endpoint, the autoloader or the conditional rendering: neoan3 doesn't seem to be set up to work nicely with VueJS. But then there is the layer of the frames that let's us easily alter the very way the core executes the rendering process. What we will do is combining the cli-tool's built-in capability to use templates with combined with the extensibility of core functionality provided by a neoan3 frame.\n\nIn order to do this we will\n1. create a new neoan3 app\n2. create a new neoan3 frame\n3. create cli-templates\n\n## 1. create a new neoan3 app\n\nIf you haven't already, please install the cli globally (`npm i -g neoan3-cli`). Then, after navigating to a new folder in our localhost (optional, you can also use neoan3's server.php to run the app), we create a new project using our terminal:\n\n`neoan3 new app video`\n\n## 2. create a new neoan3 frame\n\nAfter running `neoan3 new frame vuePhp`, we want to extend the constructor and the output of the core:\n\n```PHP\n<?php\n\/* Generated by neoan3-cli *\/\n\nnamespace Neoan3\\Frame;\n\nuse Neoan3\\Core\\Serve;\n\nclass VuePhp extends Serve\n{\n    function __construct(){\n        parent::__construct();\n    }\n    function output($params = []){\n        parent::output($params);\n    }\n}\n```\n ","insert_date":"2020-01-19 20:29:07","delete_date":null},{"id":"C93279F43B0011EABC020AA5E628989E","article_id":"575FE9D13AFA11EABC020AA5E628989E","sort":2,"content_type":"markdown","content":"After installing vue (`npm i vue`), we want to include the framework. The file \"vue\/dist\/vue.js\" includes vue's development tools while the file \"vue\/dist\/vue.min.js\" does not. So what we want to do is to include the development environment when we are serving via localhost:\n\n```PHP\nif($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == 'localhost'){\n        $this->includeJs(base . 'node_modules\/vue\/dist\/vue.js');\n} else {\n        $this->includeJs(base . 'node_modules\/vue\/dist\/vue.min.js');\n}\n```\n\nWe can place this snippet in the constructor _after_ calling the parent's constructor. \n\nneoan3's default hooks for views are\n\n- header\n- main\n- footer\n\nWhat we want to achieve is to wrap the complete main container in a vue element and subsequently use components. To achieve that, we will directly write to the js stream of neoan3 and overwrite the main container in the output function _before_ we execute the parent function:\n\n```PHP\n$this->js .= 'new Vue({el:\"#root\"});';\n$this->main = '<div id=\"root\">' . $this->main . '<\/div>';\n```\n_NOTE: there are cleaner solutions, but this \"quick & dirty\" hack is stable and reliable_\n\nYour complete frame should now look like this:\n\n```PHP\n\n<?php\n\/* Generated by neoan3-cli *\/\n\nnamespace Neoan3\\Frame;\n\nuse Neoan3\\Core\\Serve;\n\nclass VuePhp extends Serve\n{\n    function __construct()\n    {\n        parent::__construct();\n        if($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] == 'localhost'){\n            $this->includeJs(base . 'node_modules\/vue\/dist\/vue.js');\n        } else {\n            $this->includeJs(base . 'node_modules\/vue\/dist\/vue.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n   \n    function output($params = [])\n    {\n        $this->js .= 'new Vue({el:\"#root\"});';\n        $this->main = '<div id=\"root\">' . $this->main . '<\/div>';\n        parent::output($params);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhat we are still missing is a nice way to integrate\/load our custom vue components.\nWe will set it up in a way that divides view (template) and js as we want to allow for dynamically changing the templates. Additionally, we will create the possibility to use component-based css (optional). To do so, we are going to provide routes with a new function called \"vueComponents\" to be placed in our frame:\n\n```PHP\nfunction vueComponents($components, $params = []){\n    \/\/ ensure that at least \"base\" is available\n    $params['base'] = base;\n\n    \/\/ iterate through provided component names\n    foreach ($components as $component){\n        $path = path . '\/component\/' . $component . '\/' . $component  . '.ce.';\n\n        \/\/ if template exists, write template to footer\n        if(file_exists($path . $this->viewExt)){\n            $this->footer .= '<template id=\"' . $component . '\">' .\n            $this->fileContent($path . $this->viewExt, $params) . '<\/template>';\n        }\n\n        \/\/ if js exists, write to js stream\n        if(file_exists($path . 'js')){\n            $this->js .= $this->fileContent($path . 'js', $params);\n        }\n\n        \/\/ if stylesheet exists, write to style stream \n        if(file_exists($path . $this->styleExt)){\n            $this->style .= $this->fileContent($path . $this->styleExt, $params);\n        }\n    }\n    return $this;\n}\n```\n\nThis is probable a little confusing. But our plan is to make custom elements vue components that we can load into endpoints with this function.\n","insert_date":"2020-01-19 21:15:14","delete_date":null},{"id":"16D3F0F23B0311EABC020AA5E628989E","article_id":"575FE9D13AFA11EABC020AA5E628989E","sort":3,"content_type":"markdown","content":"## 3. create cli-templates\n\nThe neoan3 cli-tool generates route components per default to be used with the Unicore. For our setup, we want to directly extend the frame rather than using the Unicore layer. Additionally, we want to have a handy boilerplate for our vue components. To achieve both, we will make use of the template capability of the cli tool. The cli tool respects such templates if they are defined in a folder \"_template\" in our neoan3 app. After creating this folder, we want to create 3 files:\n\n- ce.html \n- ce.js\n- route.php\n\nWith the following content:\n\n_ce.html_\n\n```html\n<div>{{name}}<\/div>\n```\n\n_ce.js_\n\n```JavaScript\nVue.component('{{name}}', {\n    template: document.querySelector('#{{name}}')\n});\n```\n_route.php_\n\n```PHP\n<?php\n\nnamespace Neoan3\\Components;\n\nuse Neoan3\\Frame\\VuePhp;\n\nclass {{name}} extends VuePhp {\n\n    private $loadedComponents = [];\n\n    function init(){\n\n        $this->hook('main', '{{name}}')\n            ->vueComponents($this->loadedComponents)\n            ->output();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhat does this do? From now on, whenever we create a new custom element it will generate our vue component boilerplate. And whenever we create a new route component it will generate our setup intended to use these components.\n\n## How to use\n\nLet's try it out. We assume a new endpoint called \"home\":\n\n`neoan3 new component home` and chose \"route component\" using our frame.\n\nNow we generate a new vue component called \"login\":\n\n`neoan3 new component login` and chose \"custom element\"\n\nNext, we open up \"component\/home\/Home.ctrl.php\" and add \"login\" to the array $loadedComponents. (note: in case sensitive environments, please be aware that you additionally have to change the second parameter of \"->hook\" to start with a lower case letter).\n\nNow we open \"component\/home\/home.view.html\" and write the tag \"login\"\n\n`<login><\/login>`\n\nVisiting the endpoint \/home, you should now see the string \"login\".

While there is nothing wrong with handling data that way, experience has shown me that an understanding of relational databases translates well into these solutions while learning relational concepts after working with NoSQL concepts seems to be harder. In order to plan a database structure, one should start with defining relations. We will assume a simple user-model throughout this article that can be visualized like this:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"id\":1,\n    \"name\": \"joe1998\",\n    \"emails\": [\n        {\n            \"id\":1,\n            \"email\": \"joe@example.com\",\n            \"confirmation_string\": \"ABCDEFG\",\n            \"confirmed\": true\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nIn general, there are the following relations:\n\n- one-2-one\n- one-2-many\n- many-2-many (I will not cover this scenario here. If you are interested, please comment)\n\nThe first thing you notice is that \"emails\" is an array. So emails are one-2-many, meaning that one user can have multiple emails. ***I don't need that!***, you might say, but consider the following scenario: A user wants to change the registered email address. However, when submitting the new email, a typo sneaks into the new email. Your app generates a new entry into emails and sends out a confirmation email including a generated \"confirmation_string\". However, in our scenario, this email never arrives due to the typo. In a worse case, this email could arrive at a different existing mailbox. Whatever happens: we do not want to overwrite the old email. At the very least not until the new one is confirmed. In such a state, the old email must be valid until a new email is confirmed. What does this mean for our database structure? Quite simple: emails need their own table with a relation to a particular user. Without going into foreign keys and types, let's assume the following\n\n_Table ***user***_\n\n| column | key | \n| ---- | ---- |\n| id | primary, auto-increment |\n| name | |\n\n_Table ***user_email***_\n\n| column | key | \n| ---- | ---- |\n| id | primary, auto-increment |\n| user_id | |\n| email | |\n| confirmation_string | |\n| confirmed | |\n\nThese two tables offer the capability to account for every scenario we have talked through before and transactions can be made accordingly. \n\n_NOTE:_ In a real scenario, you might want to equip your tables with standardized columns like \"insert_date\", \"update_date\" and (for soft-deletes) \"delete_date\" for better data-handling and understanding.\n\nSo having these tables set up, how would you go about dealing with data?\n\n## Transaction handling\n\nMany use abstracted transaction handling via an ORM (looking at you, Laravelers). Solutions like Doctrine or Propel are clean solutions as well, but let's be honest: such approaches are hard for beginners and do not foster understanding or learning. This is why people learn how to use PDO or mysqli when starting out. However, this leads to sometimes harmless code-repetition and often dangerous injection possibilities. Therefore, let's use a library that abstracts the danger away without being too complex or too far away from native SQL: [neoan3-db](https:\/\/packagist.org\/packages\/neoan3-apps\/db).\n\nThis library comes with a simplified markup for SQL (called _easy_) which we will ignore here and instead use the identifier \">\" to write classical SQL. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. \n\n### Installation\n\nIn our project folder:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require neoan3-apps\/db\n```\n### Creating a connection\n\n```PHP\nDb::setEnvironment([\n    'name' => 'your_db',\n    'user' => 'root',\n    'password' => 'Som3S3cur3Pa55word'\n])\n```\n_NOTE:_ This class is used statically. There is no need to initiate the connection each time, nor will the function \"setEnvironment\" create a connection. The first time you execute a query a connection will automatically be established should it not exist already. It is therefore possible to place the above snippet on a relatively high level in your application.\n\n### Working with data\n\nNow that our setup is done, let's get the demo-data into the database:\n\n```PHP\n$newUser = [\n    'name' => 'joe1998',\n    'email' => 'joe@example.com'\n];\n\/\/ insert into user *\n\/\/ When auto-incremented ids are used, the function returns the new id\n$newUser['user_id'] = Db::ask('>INSERT INTO user SET name={{name}}', $newUser);\n\/\/ insert into user_email\nDb::ask('>INSERT INTO user_email SET email={{email}}, user_id={{user_id}} confirmation_string = \"ABCDE\"', $newUser);\n```\n_NOTE:_ Please ***always*** use the double curly brackets to refer to a value of a given assoc array by key! Under the hood, the class identifies the correct type and prepares a statement. You can then securely handle user-input.\n\n_* for clarity:_ \nIn the documentation you will find magic methods and a simplified markup. As stated before, we want to keep it very understandable, but the user-insert can also be written like this:\n`$id = Db::user(['name' => 'joe1998'])`","insert_date":"2020-01-09 14:08:56","delete_date":null},{"id":"A1CA19A932F311EABC020AA5E628989E","article_id":"931C4D9532E911EABC020AA5E628989E","sort":2,"content_type":"markdown","content":"### Retrieving data\n\nNow you are itching to try out the joins you worked so hard on? You could, but let's remember how our user model is supposed to look like. In order to create a format that is usable (as array) in PHP as well as (as JSON) by the front-end, we decide to use two transactions instead:\n\n```PHP\n\/\/ first we want to row of the targeted user\n$wanted = ['id'=>1];\n$user = Db::ask('>SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = {{id}}', $wanted);\nif(!empty($user){\n    \/\/ The function returns an array of results. Expecting only one result, let's assign the first result to $user\n    $user = $user[0]\n    \/\/ and then attach the email(s)\n    $user['emails'] = Db::ask('>SELECT * FROM user_email WHERE user_id = {{id}}, $wanted]);\n}\n```\nAnd that's it! Our $user will now look like this:\n\n```PHP\n[\n    'id' => 1,\n    'name' => 'joe1998'\n    'emails' => [\n        [\n            'id' => 1,\n            'user_id' => 1,\n            'email' => 'joe@example.com',\n            ...\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n```\nand can easily be passed to the front-end with \"json_encode()\"\n\n## Conclusion\nThere is a lot to be said when it comes to abstraction, using uuids, migration etc, but I hope this is a good starting point. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.","insert_date":"2020-01-09 15:20:56","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":28,"unique":22},"has_image":true},{"id":"0A420B072BDB11EA840C0AA5E628989E","name":"Install PHP 7.4 on Ubuntu","slug":"install-on-ubuntu","teaser":"Finally PHP 7.4 is out!

From concerns about third-party packages, missing security layers in your code to access issues and inconveniences - it would be too much to talk about the possible dangers. Let's just agree that running via sudo is not an option. \n\nOne of my most-used utilities is [neoan3-cli](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/neoan3-cli). Even if I am not using neoan3, the migration and credential handling is always welcome. \n\n## AWS Ubuntu instance\n\nOne of the most versatile hosting solutions is still Amazon's EC2 instances. While Amazon's Linux version seems to be the logical step, I am simply feeling more at ease with Ubuntu and am frankly a little skeptical about a distro that seems so coupled with a hosting solution (As far as I understand, the distro started out as a customization of CentOS and then branched into its own beast). Ubuntu is the perfect solution as everything we are going to talk about will be independent from your hosting solution. We are using version 18.04 but there shouldn't be any differences to prior versions in our scenario. \n\n_NOTE:_ On AWS your username will likely be \"ubuntu\" in our scenario.\n\n## The directory of global npm packages\n\nThe first thing we want to do is creating a directory within our user's home. On Ubuntu, this should be `\/home\/USERNAME\/` ( or `~\/`). We will want to create a directory for our global packages:\n\n```shell\nmkdir ~\/.npm-packages\n```\n\nNext, let's set up npm to use this directory:\n\n```shell\nnpm config set prefix \"${HOME}\/.npm-packages\"\n```\n\n## PATH variable\nIn order for node & npm to find installed packages, we should add this directory to the PATH variable. On a server you might want to do this via `nano ~\/.bashrc`.\n\nAdd the following lines:\n\n```shell\nNPM_STORE=\"${HOME}\/.npm-packages\"\n\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$NPM_STORE\/bin\"\n\n# Make sure this line is the last in the config (in case you defined MANPATH already)\n# Otherwise, fall back to `manpath` so we can inherit from `\/etc\/manpath`.\nexport MANPATH=\"${MANPATH-$(manpath)}:$NPM_STORE\/share\/man\"\n```\n## Let's try it out\n\n Assuming everything went as planned, we should now be able to use global packages without the root user or sudo. Start a new terminal window (or restart your ssh connection) and try: `npm i -g neoan3-cli`. After successful installation, the command `neoan3 -v` should output the installed version. \n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThere is a popular script out there automating this process [here](https:\/\/github.com\/glenpike\/npm-g_nosudo). Please be aware that this solution does not play well with node version manager. Otherwise it is a solid solution with many happy users.","insert_date":"2019-12-31 09:46:29","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":179,"unique":120},"has_image":false},{"id":"19AA0D23190111EA840C0AA5E628989E","name":"Static content pages - still the fastest web-experience","slug":"static-content-pages-still-the-fastest-web-experience","teaser":"Tutorial: How to utilize blua.blue to generate static content for your website.","image_id":"F99C827118FE11EA840C0AA5E628989E","author_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","category_id":"491D8297A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","is_public":1,"keywords":"php,cms,static pages","publish_date":"2019-12-07 16:41:49","insert_date":"2019-12-07 16:41:49","update_date":null,"delete_date":null,"inserted":1575736909000,"image":{"id":"F99C827118FE11EA840C0AA5E628989E","format":"image\/jpeg","path":"\/asset\/upload\/0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10\/3e7b75acdb35fc76865dda.jpeg","inserter_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","insert_date":"2019-12-07 14:36:37","delete_date":null},"rating":{"total":0,"average":null},"author":{"id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","customer_id":null,"user_type":"admin","user_name":"neoan","image_id":"951454B9E86411E9840C0AA5E628989E","insert_date":"2019-10-06 18:10:30","delete_date":null},"comments":[],"category":{"id":"491D8297A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","name":"Tutorial","insert_date":"2019-07-13 18:08:58","delete_date":null},"store":[{"id":"1A41ED8B190111EA840C0AA5E628989E","article_id":"19AA0D23190111EA840C0AA5E628989E","store_key":"dev-to-id","value":"216647","insert_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","delete_date":null}],"content":[{"id":"19ACF0D8190111EA840C0AA5E628989E","article_id":"19AA0D23190111EA840C0AA5E628989E","sort":1,"content_type":"html","content":"<p>In the constant battle of visibility, SEO and speed are important factors.

For now, registering [here](https:\/\/blua.blue\/register\/) will be enough. In order to test our blog, let's write a sample post. The things we want to ensure for now are \n- unchecking the \"Appear in search & make public\" checkbox and\n- using \"WYSIWYG (HTML)\" as content type ( dropdown choice when clicking \"add new content\")\n\nOnce this is done, let's jump to our IDE\n\n## Install the PHP SDK\n\nUsing composer, we install the PHP SDK for blua.blue\n\n`composer require blua-blue\/blua-blue-php-sdk`\n\nand then our templating:\n\n`composer require neoan3-apps\/ops`\n\n## Our blog setup\n\nOur project will consist of only two templates and one PHP file:\n\n_templates\/overview.html_\n\n_templates\/article.html_\n\n_index.php_\n\nThe overview HTML template can look however you want to. For now, I will start as simple as this:\n\n```HTML\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>My blog<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n    <div n-for=\"articles as article\">\n        <a href=\"index.php?article={%7Barticle.slug}}\">{%7Barticle.name}}<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\nNote how we use two things you might notice:\n*n-for* will iterate over articles for us while the curly braces substitute values for us just like in many other concepts you might be familiar with.\n\nIn order to better understand this, let's look at our initial index.php\n\n```PHP\n<?php\n\n\/\/ required for Ops\ndefine('path', __DIR__);\n\nrequire path . '\/vendor\/autoload.php';\n\n\/\/ use your own credentials\n$userName = 'demo';\n$password = 'sampleUser1';\n\n\/\/ initiate SDK\n$client = new \\BluaBlue\\Client($userName, $password);\n\n\/\/ render overview.html with article list\n\necho \\Neoan3\\Apps\\Ops::embraceFromFile('templates\/overview.html',[\n    'articles' => $client->getArticleList(0,300,$userName)\n]);\n```\n\nWe should already have output at this point. However, as indicated by the links in our template, we should probably account for the GET parameter \"article\" to be set or not. Let's first create a simple article template:\n\n```HTML\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>{%7Bname}}<\/title>\n<\/head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>{%7Bname}}<\/h1>\n<p n-for=\"content as part\">\n    {%7Bpart.content}}\n<\/p>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\nand then add the rendering option to our index.php\n\n```PHP\nif(isset($_GET['article'])){\n    \/\/ render article page\n   $article = $client->getArticle($_GET['article']);\n    echo \\Neoan3\\Apps\\Ops::embraceFromFile('templates\/article.html', $article );\n}\n```\n\nOur complete index.php could look something like this:\n\n```PHP\n<?php\n\n\/\/ required for Ops\ndefine('path', __DIR__);\n\nrequire path .

I did this as a proof of concept of how to build custom plugins for blua.blue in general.<\/p>\n<p>While the general approach was proven, I had outstanding problems to tackle, while allowing for the folowing rules:<\/p>\n<p>- modifications to blua.blue's models &amp; functionality are out of the question to stay future proof<\/p>\n<p>- saving credentials as plain-text in the MySQL database is not an option<\/p>\n<p>- somehow prohibit public access while not having a JWT from the user present in the webhooks<\/p>\n<h2>Outstanding problems<\/h2>\n<p>So, what where the remaining issues? Well, first of all, having the API key as server-side credentials only enabled one dev.to user-account. That is a big problem considering that a multi-user system should enable anyone with a user account to post as individual author using an individual user account. Letting people publish in my name was certainly not an option. Blua.blue has the ability to set tokens that are transmitted with the webhooks as bearer tokens. However, these tokens are stored in plain text and are intended to provide identification of the origin of a call, not to securely store credentials. So what to do?<\/p>\n<h2>The principle<\/h2>\n<p>So here is the solution I came up with: I would create an endpoint as a route for setup purposes. There you can input your API-key and send it to the plugin where a instance-specific encryption-key ( outside the public web-root via `neoan3 credentials`&nbsp; ) would encrypt and serialize it.<\/p>\n<p>In a second step, the result of this operation is then provided as token to the webhook pointing at the plugin and stored in the database.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whenever the plugin receives a call it can now revert this operation ( deserialize &amp; decrypt ) and use the result (the plain API-key) for communication with dev.to, at which point the dev.to API will either recognize the user and authentication or not.<\/p>\n<p>Since the POST-endpoint is used by the webhook and I wanted to contain the plugin to one component, I used this GET function:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"><code>function getDevTo(array $body = [])\n    {\n        \/\/ make sure only logged in users can execute this\n        Stateless::restrict();\n        $answer = [];\n        if (isset($body['apiKey'])) {\n            \/\/ assign\n            $this-&gt;apiKey = $body['apiKey'];\n            \/\/ use existing header construction\n            $header = $this-&gt;curlHeader();\n            \/\/ make a test-call with given API key to provide feedback for the frontend\n            $testAnswer = Curl::curling('https:\/\/dev.to\/api\/articles\/me',[],$header, 'GET');\n            \/\/ obtain neoan3 credentials\n            $credentials = getCredentials();\n            $key = $credentials['blua_devto']['salt'];\n            \/\/ encrypt &amp; serialize\n            $encrypted = Ops::serialize(Ops::encrypt($body['apiKey'], $key));\n            $answer = ['token' =&gt; $encrypted, 'test' =&gt; $testAnswer];\n        }\n\n        return $answer;\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In order to retrieve the API key, I had to make changes to the POST function as well:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-php\"><code>function postDevTo(array $body)\n    {\n        try {\n            $credentials = getCredentials();\n            \/\/ check token\n            if (!isset($_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'])) {\n                return ['webhook' =&gt; 'denied'];\n            }\n\n            $this-&gt;apiKey = $this-&gt;getApiKey($credentials, substr($_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'], 7));\n\n\n            switch ($body['event']) {\n                case 'created':\n                case 'updated':\n                    \/\/ find existing\n                    $update = $this-&gt;investigateStoreObject($body['payload']['store']);\n                    $devBody = $this-&gt;transformPayload($body['payload']);\n                    $this-&gt;sendToDevTo($devBody, $update);\n                    break;\n                case 'deleted':\n                    break;\n            }\n        } catch (\\Exception $e) {\n            throw new RouteException('Unable to execute dev.to plugin', 500);\n        }\n        return ['webhook' =&gt; 'received'];\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>I uploaded the changes to blua.blue and here I am using it!<\/p>\n<p>GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/devTo<\/p>\n<h2>Want to try it out?<\/h2>\n<p>Sign up at https:\/\/blua.blue and then visit https:\/\/blua.blue\/dev-to for the setup.<\/p>","insert_date":"2019-11-13 21:35:13","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":117,"unique":114},"has_image":true},{"id":"8C3D07C304C011EA840C0AA5E628989E","name":"Cross publishing to dev.to","slug":"cross-publishing-to-dev-to","teaser":"How to publish your content to dev.to from blua.blue - hopefully","image_id":"62EB2E6B13A211EA840C0AA5E628989E","author_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","category_id":"491D8297A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","is_public":1,"keywords":"dev.to,api,php","publish_date":"2019-11-11 20:23:16","insert_date":"2019-11-30 18:51:20","update_date":null,"delete_date":null,"inserted":1575139880000,"image":{"id":"62EB2E6B13A211EA840C0AA5E628989E","format":"image\/jpeg","path":"\/asset\/upload\/0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10\/b283704e291152c2b6f68f.jpeg","inserter_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","insert_date":"2019-11-30 18:51:15","delete_date":null},"rating":{"total":0,"average":null},"author":{"id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","customer_id":null,"user_type":"admin","user_name":"neoan","image_id":"951454B9E86411E9840C0AA5E628989E","insert_date":"2019-10-06 18:10:30","delete_date":null},"comments":[],"category":{"id":"491D8297A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","name":"Tutorial","insert_date":"2019-07-13 18:08:58","delete_date":null},"store":[],"content":[{"id":"8C3EE87904C011EA840C0AA5E628989E","article_id":"8C3D07C304C011EA840C0AA5E628989E","sort":1,"content_type":"html","content":"<h2>O brother where art thou?<\/h2>\n<p>I don't know where you will read this, but I would like to tell the story about how this very content came about.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, I am writing in the editor of <a href=\"..\/\">blua.blue<\/a> trying out the dev.to plugin I wrote. If everything goes to plan, you will read this post as a guide on what I did while at the same time it is the first live test of the functionality itself.<\/p>\n<h2>A little backstory<\/h2>\n<p>Blua.blue is a project facillitating content distribution as a hybrid CMS capable of<\/p>\n<p>- decoupled CMS<\/p>\n<p>- coupled CMS<\/p>\n<p>- headless CMS<\/p>\n<p>This effectively means that it ships with a frontend, a RESTful API and webhooks. What it can't do is formatting the webhook in order to target particular APIs. As with all headless CMS' it expects the endpoints to be under the control of whoever wants to publish content at a certain website or app. Unfortunately, this is simply not the case with dev.to ( At least right now, dear dev.to team: with the successful funding round in mind, do you need any additional developers? ).<\/p>\n<h2>The solution<\/h2>\n<p>The idea is pretty simple: what if a plugin received the webhook, transformed the request according to the api specs of dev.to and then sends it on?<\/p>\n<p><strong>blua.blue ---&gt; webhook to blua.blue\/dev-to ---&gt; dev.to<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The prerequisites are quite simple, I needed to convert html into markdown ( shoutout to \"the league\"&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/thephpleague\/html-to-markdown\">https:\/\/github.com\/thephpleague\/html-to-markdown <\/a>) and then simply restructure the blua.blue payload to the dev.to format. But three things bothered me. First, I did not want to rely on the events of blua.blue (created, updated, deleted) as I wanted to acount for edge cases (like what if you install the plugin to your blua.blue instance and update articles that exist there but not yet on dev.to). The second problem was finding a way to reliably match articles on blua.blue with articles on dev.to. Thankfully, the article object of blua.blue contains a store object where I could simply save the dev.to ID. This solves for both of the problems as I know now&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>a) which article is already exists at dev.to ( and therefore needs to be updated rather than created ) and&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>b) how to reliably identify the relationship between the blua.blue ID and the dev.to ID.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But what about security?<\/strong> The last problem was that I effectively created an endpoint where anybody can send an object in the right format to the plugin endpoint and that object will be published to dev.to in my name. Well, when setting up the webhooks in blua.blue, I have the ability to set up a token. So for now, I use a combination of the `neoan3 credentials` operation and the token to ensure that only my articles are processed. But of course, this means that this plugin can only be used by one user of the blua.blue installation (here me).<\/p>\n<p>In order to securly facilitate plugin use like this changes to the way blua.blue stores tokens needs to be revisited, and as usual, help is appreciated (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/blua-blue\">https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/blua-blue<\/a>). However, a good solution would go a long way as it opens up the possibility for a wide range of self-contained plugins for blua.blue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in the progress:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/devTo\">https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/devTo<\/a><\/p>","insert_date":"2019-11-11 20:19:22","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":67,"unique":59},"has_image":true},{"id":"CDFFBB92DB4611E9A34BECF4BBBEDA10","name":"Transformer - falling in love with PHP's magic methods all over again","slug":"transformer-falling-in-love-with-magic-methods-all-over-again","teaser":"PHP's magic functions have been around for a long time.

I have been involved in hiring developers for years and not once did I ever wonder if being able to write a tag for Atom feeds must be known without google or that being able to disect intentionally misleading chained JavaScript functions provide valuable insight on the abilities of a candidate. Worse, the opposite is the case. A quick typist and strong \"googler\" can ace these tests while being completely useless as a developer. So what are they for?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it seems that companies can't be bothered with candidates that would&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>lie about their experience<\/li>\n<li>arrange fake recommendations<\/li>\n<li>steal links\/projects and pretend they made them<\/li>\n<li>think that this will make them land &amp; keep a job they are not qualified for<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But I am sure that these people could not ask someone else to do these assessments for them, could they? Just not the type of personality?<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the consequesnces of this practice? The 99% of us will be humiliated with \"How to declare a doctype\" for the rest of our lives.<\/p>\n<h2>Is it all BS then?<\/h2>\n<p>Just to be clear. I am a fan of technical interviews that are closely related to the technology used and that are designed to reveal the ability to solve problems. And if you need your ability to find the right StackOverflow page to achieve it, that is fine.<\/p>\n<p>But most importantly I am interested in the ability to learn, adapt and innovate. And I have yet to see the pre-assessment test that would target any relevant skill whatsoever. But it is worse:<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are humans training\/learning for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting with school we are conditioned to always look at the very next goal. And test results, grades &amp; report cards <strong>must<\/strong> have value to our subconciousness in order to justify the endless hours we invested in it. It is only natural that this process eliminates a clear picture of what abilities are useful and what content relevant. It is not only a misconception, but dangerous to associate \"I can pass bootcamp\/company x's assessment test\" with \"I can write HTML\/JavaScript applications\". However, there are counselors, recruiting firms and authors creating a complete industry on \"how to pass assessment tests\". This is madness! How many more generations of young web developers will have to be dropped into corporate America's lap realizing \"This is so different than what I learned\"? And on the other side: How many more managers will have to find out that the new hire who aced the assessment test just doesn't have what the position requires?<\/p>\n<p>If you are a web developer you should spend your time on projects, new concepts, new patterns, new frameworks, new languages, and so on. Don't waste your time. The industry has a demand and we are the supplier. Let's remember that.<\/p>\n<h2>What to do about the status quo?<\/h2>\n<p>Well, two things must happen. Developers in hiring positions in the industry have to digest what I said a paragraph earlier: Just because we went through this nonsense does not mean we should expect the new recruits to pass the same hurdle. Let's design better filters for what we think must be established in order to justify interviewing time. Let's not quickly surf around and see what the others are doing to assess or hire a flashy startup using ancient IBM tests to outsource pre-asessment to.<\/p>\n<p>And for the canditates: Give feedback!

You can also download the complete project and use this tutorial as explanation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Complete files: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/basic-node-example\/archive\/v1.0.0.zip\">Download ZIP<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/blua-blue\/basic-node-example\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View on GITHub<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>blua.blue<\/h2>\n<p>The headless neoan3 based CMS blua.blue is open source and can be hosted wherever you want. For this simple tutorial, we are going to sign up here: <a href=\"..\/register\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blua.blue registration<\/a><\/p>\n<p>After confirming our email, we are ready to use the API to our liking. It might make sense to write your first article if you feel like it (as a matter of fact, this very toturial has been created in blua.blue).<\/p>\n<p>We are using node as once we gather are solid understanding of the capabilities of a headless CMS, we will see the SEO advantage of rendering content server side (but that is a topic for another post).<\/p>\n<h2>1. Installing prerequisites<\/h2>\n<p>Let's create a project folder. You can name this folder however you want, but I will simply refer to it as \"app-folder\" here. Let us start by installing the we will need via npm<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>npm install express pug axios --save\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>While express will be our server we will use pug (former jade) as a template engine and axios to handle our requests to blua.blue<\/p>\n<p>By default, express expects templates to be in the folder <em>views, <\/em>so we might as well create this folder now. To present you with an overview, this will be the file structure at the end:<\/p>\n<div style=\"background: rgba(0,0,0,.7); padding: 5px;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #ecf0f1;\">views\/<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ecf0f1;\">-- list.pug<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ecf0f1;\">blua-api.js<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ecf0f1;\">server.js<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>To give express a basic spin, let's test if everything runs: Create a file list.pug in \/views and enter some basic markup.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code>html\n    head\n        title My articles   \n    body\n        h1 Test<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now we create the file (if you haven't already) <em>server.js&nbsp;<\/em>and start defining your express server:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n\/\/ Routing is crucial. If you are not familiar with route definitions, please look into express documentation \n\napp.get('\/', function (req, res) {\n       res.render('list', function(err,html){\n            res.send(html);\n        })\n});\n\n\/\/ And let us serve on port 3000 \napp.listen(3000, function () {\n    console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');\n});<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Running <code>node serve.js<\/code> should give us a running application @ http:\/\/localhost:3000<\/p>\n<h2>2. Api wrapper<\/h2>\n<p>One could argue that it is overkill for our purposes, but I want to create a setup that allows you to go beyond this tutorial with the codebase we create. Let us therefore create the file blua-api.js now:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const axios = require('axios');\n\n\/\/ Change this line if you are hosting blua.blue yourself\nlet baseUrl = 'https:\/\/blua.blue\/api.v1\/';\n\nconst api = {\n    config: {\n        baseURL: baseUrl,\n        timeout: 2000,\n        headers:{}\n    },\n    token: false,\n    connected:false,\n    init: async (user, password) =&gt; {\n        if(!this.connected){\n            let instance = axios.create(api.config);\n            await instance.post('login',{username:user,password:password}).then(res=&gt;{\n                api.token = res.data.token;\n                api.connected = true;\n                api.config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${res.data.token}`;\n                instance = axios.create(api.config);\n            }).catch(err=&gt;{\n                console.log(err);\n                process.end()\n            });\n            return instance;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = api;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>As you can see we are prepared to make authorized calls with a JWT token with one simple step. The function <em>init<\/em> returns an axios instance. If you are not familiar with axios, or would rather use javaScript's fetch, feel free to implement another solution. Here we want to make sure that the very first call authenticates us and all subsequent calls are authenticated. The usage will be:<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const bluaBlue = require('.\/blua-api.js');\n\nbluaBlue.init('your-username','your-password').then(api=&gt;{\n    \/\/ make any call documented in https:\/\/blua.blue\/api-documentation\n    api.get('article?slug=my-article').then(...);\n\n});<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: While not covered in this tutorial, your JWT will expire once in a while. You will receive \"unauthorized\" 401 responses in such cases that you can catch. You may simply run <em>init <\/em>again but set the wrappers property <em>connected<\/em> to false so authentication runs again.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Collecting &amp; Rendering a list of your articles<\/h2>\n<p>I don't want to get into design in this tutorial, so we'll use bootstrap for a basic expandable list since I think most people have at least a minimum experience with it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>More or less taken exactly from bootstrap's documentation, let's get back and enhance our template (<em>views\/list.pug<\/em>)<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code>html\n    head\n        title My articles\n        \/\/ let's use the bootstrap files via CDN\n        link(rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https:\/\/stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com\/bootstrap\/4.3.1\/css\/bootstrap.min.css\")\n        script(src=\"https:\/\/code.jquery.com\/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\")\n        script(src=\"https:\/\/cdnjs.cloudflare.com\/ajax\/libs\/popper.js\/1.14.7\/umd\/popper.min.js\")\n        script(src=\"https:\/\/stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com\/bootstrap\/4.3.1\/js\/bootstrap.min.js\")\n    body\n        .container\n            h1 My articles\n            .accordion#article-list\n                \/\/ We don't have any articles yet, but we will want to iterate over them.\n                each article in articles\n                    .card\n                        .card-header\n                            h2.mb-0\n                                button.btn.btn-link(type=\"button\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#\"+article.slug) #{article.name}\n                        .collapse(id=article.slug data-parent=\"#article-list\")\n                            .card-body\n                                p #{article.teaser}\n                                a.btn.btn-success(href=\"https:\/\/blua.blue\/article\/\"+article.slug target=\"_blank\") read<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>So what do we want to achieve? Our app is supposed to fetch all articles of a particular author (you?) and list them. So we will redesign our <em>server.js<\/em> to make a call to blua.blue when a client requests the home page ( <em>get('\/')<\/em> ). As mentioned before, the api wrapper sends authenticated calls after initiation. The easiest approach is to wrap our server logic in this wrapper.<\/p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>const express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.set('view engine', 'pug');\nconst bluaBlue = require('.\/blua-api.js');\n\n\n\/\/ you will want to set your credentials right\nbluaBlue.init('your-username','your-password').then(blua=&gt;{\n    app.get('\/', function (req, res) {\n        \/\/ set the author accordingly. If you have not written any articles yet, use \"neoan\" to test\n        blua.get('articleList?author=your-username').then(d=&gt;{\n            \/\/ be sure to include the data here\n            res.render('list', {articles:d.data}, function(err,html){\n                res.send(html);\n            })\n        });\n    });\n\n    app.listen(3000, function () {\n        console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');\n    });\n});<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>That's it!<\/h2>\n<p>If you run in any problems when running <code>node server.js<\/code> , you might want to run your application in debug mode. For Windows this means running <code>set DEBUG=express:* node server.js<\/code> .<\/p>\n<p>Now you are on your own. Can you create dynamic routes for your articles rather than directing the visitors to blua.blue? Can you look into the objects and find additional content you want to use? Are you bold enough to try to update one of your articles?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","insert_date":"2019-09-06 23:11:06","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":86,"unique":85},"has_image":true},{"id":"320F4687CF5F11E9A34BECF4BBBEDA10","name":"Help us document neoan3","slug":"help-us-document-neoan3","teaser":"Over 4000 brave developers are exploring the framework on their own.","image_id":"44E674AD139F11EA840C0AA5E628989E","author_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","category_id":"8248B866A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","is_public":1,"keywords":"php,neoan3,open source,github","publish_date":"2019-09-04 18:17:15","insert_date":"2019-11-30 18:28:59","update_date":null,"delete_date":null,"inserted":1575138539000,"image":{"id":"44E674AD139F11EA840C0AA5E628989E","format":"image\/jpeg","path":"\/asset\/upload\/0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10\/276863d82d5a271c8438f7.jpeg","inserter_user_id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","insert_date":"2019-11-30 18:28:56","delete_date":null},"rating":{"total":1,"average":"4.0000"},"author":{"id":"0EC796E5A57611E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","customer_id":null,"user_type":"admin","user_name":"neoan","image_id":"951454B9E86411E9840C0AA5E628989E","insert_date":"2019-10-06 18:10:30","delete_date":null},"comments":[],"category":{"id":"8248B866A59911E992F0ECF4BBBEDA10","name":"Other","insert_date":"2019-07-13 18:10:34","delete_date":null},"store":[{"id":"46F3CA90139F11EA840C0AA5E628989E","article_id":"320F4687CF5F11E9A34BECF4BBBEDA10","store_key":"dev-to-id","value":"213326","insert_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","delete_date":null}],"content":[{"id":"320FBF08CF5F11E9A34BECF4BBBEDA10","article_id":"320F4687CF5F11E9A34BECF4BBBEDA10","sort":1,"content_type":"html","content":"<h1>What do you do if people start using your project before you are prepared for a release?<\/h1>\n<p>The back-story: <a href=\"http:\/\/neoan.us\/neoan3docs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">neoan3<\/a>'s predecesor is the conclusion of a framework originally designed to teach coding with a very low entry hurdle.

What happened?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it started with a tweet critizising the organisation with not having any women as speakers in their lineup. The response from phpce was clear and transparent: There was only one submission from a woman who would have repeated a presentation she already held.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Can this be true in 2019? Of course! All the gender-study courses, the \"women in STEM\" effords and nth-wave feminism movements did not change the fact that the industry is still mainly male.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This doesn't not mean that there aren't any women in the field. Especially in the CMS and IoT realm more and more women surface within the community. But I am not here to discuss my position on \"equal opportunity\" vs. \"equal outcome\"; I am writing these lines to remind the community of who we are.<\/p>\n<h2>The misfits<\/h2>\n<p>Many of today's personalities in the community have been the \"nerds\" in their school-years, the keyboard-warriors against inhumane capitalism, the revolutionary justice-hackers or the social media activists. <em>And yet, there is nothing as neutral as code<\/em>. Whether you are a transgender block-chain guru, a female Laravel artisan, or a black gay encryption enthusiast - the community always judged you (so usually ripped you apart *g*) based on your code and competency. In other words,<\/p>\n<p><strong>despite the fact that men are over-represented, the community has always been inclusive<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>But back to the story: The critics claim that phpce should have actively searched for female speakers, dispite the fact that speaking at an event is intentionally organized by submitting a request to speak. And let's not forget what that means:<\/p>\n<p>An ever-changing community that does not create its small, encapsuled elite <strong>must<\/strong> depend on the fair possibility to enter the lineup by participation. As soon as this principle is in danger we create the opposite of what the critics want (assuming they have good intentions).&nbsp;<\/p>","insert_date":"2019-08-26 13:05:54","delete_date":null}],"metrics":{"total":49,"unique":45},"has_image":true}]
